        Todays plastic filled reefs have many problems for many species, and
        we're researching how proper ecotourism can fix that.

      <details>
        <summary>How does your behavior affect the ocean?</summary>
        <p>
          Our behavior, from stealing little pieces of coral, to throwing away
          your plastic bottles in the water, to smashing spirit bottles in the
          sand, all adversely affect the environment. That little piece of of
          coral you took because it looked colorful and nice? Outside of the
          water it greys and dies. the plastic bottle you threw in the water? it
          will kill an unsuspecting fish, looking for a meal. That spirit bottle
          you broke on the beach? it'll impale a baby turtle in the stomach and
          kill it. so join us in saving these animals, with simple good
          behavior.
